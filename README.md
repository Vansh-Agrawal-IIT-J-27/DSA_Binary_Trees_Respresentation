# Binary Tree Visualizer

A C++ application that provides a graphical and textual representation of binary trees using the Qt framework. This tool allows users to visualize binary tree structures, explore traversal algorithms, and interact with various tree operations in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.

## Features
- Interactive Tree Visualization
  - Display binary trees graphically with clear node relationships
  - Customizable node colors, background colors, and text colors
- File Management
  - Load and save tree structures for later use
  - Reset the tree to start fresh
- Dynamic Node Operations
  - Insert and delete nodes interactively
  - View properties of each node
- Traversal Algorithms
  - Supports In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order traversals
  - Displays traversal results for algorithm analysis
- Properties Panel
  - Provides tree metrics like Height, Node Count, Leaf Nodes, etc.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: C++
- GUI Framework: Qt (Qt Creator IDE)
- Data Structures: Queues, Stacks

## Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

- Qt Framework: Ensure that you have Qt installed on your system.
- C++ Compiler: A modern C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.
