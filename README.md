**Binary Tree Visualizer**

A C++ application that provides a graphical and textual representation of binary trees using the Qt framework. This tool allows users to visualize binary tree structures, explore traversal algorithms, and interact with various tree operations in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.

**Features**

i) Interactive Tree Visualization:

Display binary trees graphically with clear node relationships.

Customizable node colors, background colors, and text colors.

ii) File Management:

Load and save tree structures for later use.

Reset the tree to start fresh or exit the application easily.

iii) Dynamic Node Operations:

Insert and delete nodes interactively.

View properties of each node and modify the tree dynamically.

iv) Traversal Algorithms:

Supports In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order traversals.

Displays traversal results for better understanding of algorithm behavior.

v) Properties Panel:

Provides tree statistics including Height, Node Count, Leaf Nodes, and Internal Nodes.

Real-time updates of traversal outputs and tree metrics.

i) Zoom and Navigation:

Zoom in and out for better visualization of large trees.

**Technologies Used**

Programming Language: C++

GUI Framework: Qt (Qt Creator IDE)

Data Structures: Linked Nodes, Queues, Stacks

**Installation & Setup**

Prerequisites

Qt Framework: Ensure that you have Qt installed on your system.
