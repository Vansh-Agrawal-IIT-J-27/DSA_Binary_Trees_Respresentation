# **Binary Tree Visualizer**

## **Project Overview**

Welcome to the **Binary Tree Visualizer**! This project is a web-based tool that allows you to visualize various binary trees, perform different tree operations, and explore tree traversal algorithms. The visualizer is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, providing an interactive and educational experience for understanding how binary trees work.

### **Features**

- **Tree Implementations**:
  - **Binary Tree**
  - **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
  - **AVL Tree (Self-balancing Binary Search Tree)**
  - **Red-Black Tree (Balanced Binary Search Tree)**
  
- **Supported Operations**:
  - **Insertion**: Add new nodes to the tree.
  - **Deletion**: Remove nodes from the tree.
  - **Search**: Find nodes within the tree.

- **Tree Traversal Algorithms**:
  - **In-order Traversal**
  - **Pre-order Traversal**
  - **Post-order Traversal**

- **Interactive Visualization**:
  - Visual representation of trees and their structure.
  - Dynamic animations for tree operations (insert, delete, search).
  - Step-by-step display of traversal algorithms.

## **Tech Stack**

- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout for a user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality for tree operations, visualizations, and user interactions.

## **How to Use the Visualizer**

1. **Select the Tree Type**:
   - Choose from Binary Tree, BST, AVL, or Red-Black Tree.

2. **Perform Operations**:
   - Use the input fields and buttons to **insert**, **delete**, or **search** nodes.
   - Watch as the tree updates dynamically with animations.

3. **Tree Traversal**:
   - Select a traversal type (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order).
   - The visualizer will highlight the nodes in the chosen traversal order.
