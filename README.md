# Binary Tree Visualizer

This project is a web-based application designed to visualize various binary tree data structures and their operations. It offers a user-friendly interface to explore and understand concepts like binary search trees (BSTs), AVL trees, and Red-Black trees.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Features

* **Tree Visualization:**
    * Dynamically displays the structure of binary trees.
    * Highlights nodes and edges during traversal and operations.
    * Provides clear visual representation of tree operations.
* **Tree Operations:**
    * **Insertion:** Adds nodes to the tree at appropriate positions.
    * **Deletion:** Removes nodes from the tree while maintaining tree structure.
    * **Search:** Finds specific nodes within the tree.
* **Traversal Algorithms:**
    * **In-order Traversal:** Visits nodes in ascending order.
    * **Pre-order Traversal:** Visits the root node first, then left subtree, and then right subtree.
    * **Post-order Traversal:** Visits left subtree, then right subtree, and then the root node.
* **Tree Types:**
    * **Binary Tree:** A basic tree structure with at most two children per node.
    * **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A binary tree where nodes are arranged in a specific order.
    * **AVL Tree:** A self-balancing BST that ensures efficient operations.
    * **Red-Black Tree:** A self-balancing BST that guarantees logarithmic time complexity for operations.
